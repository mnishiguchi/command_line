# Hardware security

When hardware is physically accessible, security can be compromised by:

- Key logging: Recording the real time activity of a computer user including the keys they press. The captured data can either be stored locally or transmitted to remote machines
- Network sniffing: Capturing and viewing the network packet level data on your network
- Booting with a live or rescue disk
- Remounting and modifying disk content


## How to properly secure physical access to servers and workstations

The guidelines of security:

- Lock down workstations and servers
- Protect your network links such that it cannot be accessed by people you do not trust
- Protect your keyboards where passwords are entered to ensure the keyboards cannot be tampered with
- Ensure a password protects the BIOS in such a way that the system cannot be booted with a live or rescue DVD or USB key
