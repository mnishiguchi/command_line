# Domain name system (DNS)
- DNS (Domain Name System) is used for converting Internet domain and host names to IP addresses

## Name Resolution
- convert numerical IP address values into a human-readable format known as the hostname. 
- e.g., `140.211.169.4` is the numerical IP address that refers to the linuxfoundation.org hostname. 

## The special hostname localhost
- associated with the IP address `127.0.0.1`
- describes the machine you are currently on (which normally has additional network-related IP addresses).

## Domain Name System (DNS) and Name Resolution Tools

### Viewing `/etc/hosts` file

```
$ cat /etc/hosts
##
# Host Database
#
# localhost is used to configure the loopback interface
# when the system is booting.  Do not change this entry.
##
127.0.0.1   localhost
255.255.255.255 broadcasthost
::1             localhost
```

### Viewing `/etc/resolv.conf` file

```
$ cat /etc/resolv.conf
#
# Mac OS X Notice
#
# This file is not used by the host name and address resolution
# or the DNS query routing mechanisms used by most processes on
# this Mac OS X system.

nameserver 75.75.75.75
nameserver 75.75.76.76
nameserver 2001:558:feed::1
nameserver 2001:558:feed::2
```

### host - DNS lookup utility

```
$ host linuxfoundation.org
linuxfoundation.org has address 140.211.169.4
linuxfoundation.org mail is handled by 1 ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM.
linuxfoundation.org mail is handled by 5 ALT1.ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM.
linuxfoundation.org mail is handled by 5 ALT2.ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM.
linuxfoundation.org mail is handled by 10 ASPMX2.GOOGLEMAIL.COM.
linuxfoundation.org mail is handled by 10 ASPMX3.GOOGLEMAIL.COM.
```

### `nslookup` - query Internet name servers interactively

```
$ nslookup linuxfoundation.org
Server:     75.75.75.75
