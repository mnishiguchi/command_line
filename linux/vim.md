**Command**

**Insert**

- Type `i` to switch to Insert mode from Command mode
- Used to enter (insert)  text into a file
- Indicated by an "? INSERT ?" indicator at the bottom of the screen
- Press `Esc` to exit Insert mode (return to Command mode)

**Line**

- Type `:` to switch to the Line mode from Command mode.
- Each key is an external command
- Uses line editing commands inherited from older line editors
- Some line editing commands are very powerful.
- Press `Esc` to exit Line mode and return to Command mode.

## Using External Commands

`:sh`
- Open an external command shell
- When you exit the shell, you will resume your vi editing session

`:!executes`
- Run a command from within vi
- Best suited for non-interactive commands such as: `:! wc %`
- The character `%` represents the file currently being edited.

`:%!fmt`
- Do simple formatting of text so that the file will look nice
- Run the entire file through fmt and replaces the file with the results
