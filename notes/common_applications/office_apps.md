# Office Applications

- Productivity applications (sometimes called office suites)
- Each suite is a collection of closely coupled programs used to create and edit different kinds of files such as:
    * Text (articles, books, reports etc.)
    * Spreadsheet
    * Presentation
    * Graphical objects
