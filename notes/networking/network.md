# Network

## What is network?

- A group of computers and computing devices connected together through communication channels, such as cables or wireless media.
- May be in the same geographical area or spread across the world.
- Used to:
    + Allow the connected devices to communicate with each other.
    + Enable multiple users to share devices over the network, such as printers and scanners.
    + Share and manage information across computers easily.
- The Internet is the largest network in the world and is often called "the network of networks".
- A network requires the connection of many nodes.
- Data moves from source to destination by passing through a series of routers and potentially across multiple networks.

## IP addresses

- Devices attached to a network **must have at least one** unique network address identifier known as the IP (Internet Protocol) address.
- Essential for routing packets of information through the network.

==

## Packets
- Exchanging information across the network requires using streams of bite-sized packets, each of which contains a piece of the information going from one machine to another
- contain
    + data buffers
    + headers
        * where the packet is going to
        * where the packet is coming from
        * where it fits in the sequence of packets that constitute the stream.

## IPv4 and IPv6
- There are two different types of IP addresses available: IPv4 (version 4) and IPv6 (version 6).
- 
IPv4 is older and by far the more widely used, while IPv6 is newer and is designed to get past the limitations of the older standard and furnish many more possible addresses.

### IPv4
- uses 32-bits for addresses
- only 4.3 billion unique addresses available
- many addresses are allotted and reserved but not actually used
- becoming inadequate because the number of devices available on the global network has significantly increased over the past years.

### IPv6
- uses 128-bits for addresses
- allows for 3.4 x 1038 unique addresses.
- it is difficult to move to IPv6 as the two protocols do not inter-operate. 
- migrating equipment and addresses to IPv6 requires significant effort and hasn't been as fast as was originally intended.

## Network interface card

- A connection channel between a device and a network.
    + Physically through a network interface card (NIC) or
    + Abstractly implemented as software.
- We can have multiple network interfaces operating at once.
- Specific interfaces can be brought up (activated) or brought down (de-activated) at any time.

- HTTP
- FTP
